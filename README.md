**Java OOP Concepts**


This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It covers the four fundamental principles:
Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction with practical examples. The code demonstrates key OOP features such as class and
object creation, method overloading and overriding, interfaces, abstract classes, constructors, and access modifiers. This project is designed
to help developers understand and apply OOP principles effectively in Java-based applications.
